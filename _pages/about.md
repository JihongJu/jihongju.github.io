For both machines and human, it is crucial to monitor the current stage of learning.

The motivation of the blog is to apply version control to my knowledge about machine learning. The idea is to quickly iterate my knowledge starting from simple and straightforward concepts towards complex but organized graphs.

Mistakes and bugs are therefore inevitable. You are more than welcome to contact me by either leaving a message in the bottom of the blogs or [sending me an email](mailto:daniel.jihong.ju@gmail.com)


### About me

I am currently finishing my master thesis project at [Computer Vision lab, TU Delft](http://visionlab.tudelft.nl/) and [IBM Centers for Advanced Studies](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/cas/benelux/). The subject is learning semantic image segmentation in the presence of label noise.

I am open to any projects/opportunities in __Computer Vision__ or __Natural Language Processing__.
