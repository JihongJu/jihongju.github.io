Are you also fascinated with the rise of Artificial Intelligence? Don't you think applications like automated image captioning is amazing? Are you curious about the magic behind learning machines? You won't be alone. I am with you.

This blog shares my understanding of ideas used in machine learning. These ideas often inspire me with solving problems in many aspects other than where they came from. Sharing these ideas, to me, is a great opportunity to digest them for another time which always brings me surprises.

I am a master student at the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Currently, I am working on my master thesis project at [Computer Vision lab](http://visionlab.tudelft.nl/) and [IBM Centers for Advanced Studies](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/cas/benelux/). The subject of my thesis is learning semantic image segmentation with crowdsourcing annotations.
