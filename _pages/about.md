### About this blog

I am in a progress of equipping myself with the fundamental theory and the proceedings of machine learning and deep learning. This blog aims at archiving my understanding of problems and sees how it improves. Though some of the ideas do not have an immediate effect, they often inspire me in many aspects other than where they came from. Apart from that, trying to uncover the secrets behind magic itself is very fascinating.

Mistakes in the posts are inevitable because, as I said, my understanding of the concepts and ideas is far from perfect. Therefore, I will be more than happy to hear from you, correcting me when I am wrong or pointing out where is unclear. Discussions are one of the methods that improve my understanding efficiently.

### About me

I am currently a master student at the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/). At the moment, I am busy with my master thesis project at [Computer Vision lab](http://visionlab.tudelft.nl/) and [IBM Centers for Advanced Studies](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/cas/benelux/). The subject is learning semantic image segmentation with crowdsourcing annotations.

I am open to any projects/opportunities in __Computer Vision__ or __Natural Language Processing__.
