Loss function is on of the principle components in solving optimization problem, and optimization is one of the most important topic of machine learning. So I'd like to have a post categorized loss functions based on use cases. It is difficult to include very single loss functions being used, so I will focus on losses that I have encountered many times. This post will be continuously updating because I will find more and more losses interesting.

## Classification problem

### Hinge loss and scores

### Softmax loss and probability


## Regression problem

### Mean squared error (MSE)
