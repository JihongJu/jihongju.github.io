In problems where we have a set of observed variables **X** and a set of target variables **Y**: 

Observed variables **X**={xi|i=1,2,...,M}

Target variables **Y**={yj|j=1,2,...,N}

The goal is to model the conditional distribution P(**Y**|**X**). There are many application of such a problem in practice, like [image segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation), [Part-Of-Speech tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging), etc.



## Condition Random Field as Markov Network

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model the conditional distribution P(**Y**|**X**) and can be represented by a special form of Markov Network (Figure 1).

Figure 1. An example Markov Network representation of Conditional Random Field. [1] The circles and the double circles denote the the target variables Y and the observed variables X respectively. The links refer to the dependencies among the random variables. 

As we can see from Figure 1, there is no edge among observed variables. This doesn't mean the observed variables **X** are independent of each other. The dependencies are just not interesting in representing the conditional distribution P(**Y**|**X**).



## Condition Random Field as Factor Graph

The Markov Network representation is ambiguous. Figure 2 gives a simple example about the ambiguity of the Markov Network.

Figure 2. Both of the factor graphs (middle and right) correspond to the same Markov Network (left). [2]

To disambiguate the Markov Network representation of Conditional Random Field is the factor graph representation. Figure 3 demonstrates the same Conditional Random Field represented as a factor graph.
