Currently, I am a Computer Vision Engineer at [Qualcomm XR Labs](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/extended-reality), where I work on advancing 3D reconstruction and understanding technologies for AR/VR glasses. I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in 2017.
