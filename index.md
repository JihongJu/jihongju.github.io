Currently, I am a Computer Vision Engineer at [Qualcomm XR Labs](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/extended-reality), where I work on advancing 3D reconstruction and understanding technologies for AR/VR glasses. I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in 2017. For more information about my work and background, feel free to explore [my profile]({{ site.baseurl }}/about).

My research interests lie in 3D Computer Vision and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Specifically, I am exploring multi-modal perception systems for applications in AR/VR, autonomous driving, and robotics. Here is a list of [selected publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publication).

In my spare time, I enjoy expanding my knowledge. Some of my insights are shared as [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) and [medium articles](https://medium.com/@jihongju). I was also actively involved in open-source contributions. Feel free to explore my [Github repositories](https://github.com/JihongJu).
